# Alternate DotNetCore.CodeAlignment

This is an alternate version of the [DotNetCore.CodeAlignment](https://github.com/Mike-EEE/DotNetCore.CodeAlignment) repo.  This version features additional benchmark cases to demonstrate the problem more readily.  It is a little more involved than what is necessary to produce the problem, but still valuable to go through all the cases, so I thought I would post it here.

Additionally, if for some reason the observed issues cannot be reproduced from the original repo, then this should serve as a definitive example and source to do so.  If you still cannot reproduce this issue after trying this alternate sample set, then I want your computer. :)
